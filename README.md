# MINEFINDER
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: A clone of the game Minesweeper


#### TODO:
##### Sooner:
- implement "first click is always safe" feature
- implement Mark feature
  - gotta figure out logic around clearing Marked squares

##### Later:
- move Game class and various util functions into a separate file (they're only there because of the requirement to have three custom functions at the same level as main), probably move util functions into the class
